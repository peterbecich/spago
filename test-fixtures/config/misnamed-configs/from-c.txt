Reading Spago workspace configuration...

âœ˜ No spago.yaml found in the current directory or any of its parents.


  Instead found these:
    "../../../spago.yml"
    "../spago.yml"
    "spago.yml"
  Note that Spago config files should be named spago.yaml, not spago.yml.


The configuration file help can be found here https://github.com/purescript/spago#the-configuration-file
